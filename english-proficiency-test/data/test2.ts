    passage: 'In Vietnam, like many places, teenagers love their smartphones for everything from studying on Zalo or watching TikTok. However, this constant screen time is creating a modern health problem known as “text neck.” This issue is becoming increasingly common among young people, caused by the posture we adopt when looking down at our devices for hours every day.\nWhat exactly happens when you get text neck? Normally, your head weighs about 5 kilograms. But when you bend your neck forward 60 degrees to look at your phone, the force on your spine increases to a staggering 27 kilograms. This extra strain can lead to significant issues, including a curving of the neck, which over time is not designed to support for long periods.\nThe effects of text neck can be disruptive. In the short term, immediate symptoms are often temporary and include a stiff neck, pain in the shoulders and back, and frequent headaches. If ignored, however, these can lead to more serious, long-term problems such as permanent damage to the spine, reduced lung capacity, and even neurological problems.\nThe good news is that preventing text neck is simple. You can make a huge difference by holding your phone at eye level instead of looking down. It’s also important to take regular breaks every 20-30 minutes to look up and stretch. Simple exercises for your neck and shoulders can also help release tension and keep your spine healthy.',
